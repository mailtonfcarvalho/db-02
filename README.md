### Project Specification

This project is the specification of the Concurrency Control Technique of DBMS. Here is used a control technique that are used to ensure the noninterference or isolation property of concurrently executing transactions.

The technique used is shared/exclusive locking scheme. When we use the the system must enforce the following rules:

1. A transaction T must issue the operation read_lock(X) or write_lock(X) before any read_item(X) operation is performed in T.
2. A transaction T must issue the operation write_lock(X) before any write_item(X) operation is performed in T.
3. A transaction T must issue the operation unlock(X) after all read_item(X) and write_item(X) operations are completed in T.3
4. A transaction T will not issue a read_lock(X) operation if it already holds a read (shared) lock or a write (exclusive) lock on item X. This rule may be relaxed, as we discuss shortly.
5. A transaction T will not issue a write_lock(X) operation if it already holds a read (shared) lock or write (exclusive) lock on item X. This rule may also be relaxed, as we discuss shortly.
6. A transaction T will not issue an unlock(X) operation unless it already holds a read (shared) lock or a write (exclusive) lock on item X.
